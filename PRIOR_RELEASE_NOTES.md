This document contains historical release notes from the last minor
release and prior.  The current release notes and subsequent patch
releases can be found [RELEASE\_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## 12.7.0 (2016-06-20)

### Chef Server
  * Add support for service credential rotation via [Veil](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/blob/3ff412b5a2e6ad54cfa79bca6865e1bbca28fe5e/omnibus/files/veil/README.md), and for requiring it via the added `require-credential-rotation` command of `cinc-server-ctl`.
  * Fixed existing process detection in oc_id which caused high CPU utilization
  * Fixed bug where deleting a user would not delete pending invites.
  * Allow filtering users by their external_authentication_uid, allowing for SAML-authentication in Chef-Manage.

### Security Updates

* The update of OpenSSL 1.0.1t addresses the following:
  * [CVE-2016-2105](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2105)
  * [CVE-2016-2106](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2106)
  * [CVE-2016-2107](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2107)
  * [CVE-2016-2109](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2109)
  * [CVE-2016-2176](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2176)

### API Changes

  * `GET /users` now allows filtering by `external_authentication_uid`.
    For example, `GET /users?external_authentication_uid=jane%40doe.com` will
    now return the users whose external_authentication_uid is `jane@doe.com`.
    This change is available under API v0 and later.


## 12.6.0 (2016-04-30)

### Chef Server
  * Fixed false failures for postgres preflight check.
  * Fixed bug where public\_key\_read\_access group was not properly being respected for access on org-scoped user and client public key reads.
  * Update licensing handling to make licensing information easier to find (see [here](https://www.chef.io/blog/2016/04/26/changes-to-how-chef-products-handle-licens
es/)).

## 12.5.0 (2016-03-22)

### Chef Server
  * Added /orgs/org/users/user/keys(/key) endpoint and changed default perms on org scoped key GETs.
		The following endpoints' GET methods can now be accessed by any requestor that is a member of the same organization:
		/organizations/:org/clients/:client/keys
		/organizations/:org/clients/:client/keys/:key
		/organizations/:org/users/:user/keys
		/organizations/:org/users/:user/keys/:key
		The above org-scoped user keys endpoints are new and access to them can be controlled by an admin by editing memebership
		of the public_key_read_access group.
	* Added support for Ubuntu 14 Trusty.
	* Bugfixes for cinc-server-ctl backup.

### JRE
  * Updated to 8u74.

### OpenSSL
  * Updated to 1.0.1s to mitigate DROWN.

### NodeJS
  * Updated to 0.10.35 to mitigate CVE-2013-4450.

## Ruby On Rails
  * Updated rails to 4.2.5.2 to mitigate CVE-2016-2097 and CVE-2016-2098.

## PostgreSQL
  * Updated to 9.2.15.

## 12.4.0 (2016-01-28)

### `oc-id`
  * Pulled in a new version of Rails for `oc-id` due to critical vulnerabilities found in Rails: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2016/1/25/Rails-5-0-0-beta1-1-4-2-5-1-4-1-14-1-3-2-22-1-and-rails-html-sanitizer-1-0-3-have-been-released/

### Chef Server
  * There is now a Universe endpoint, which provides the same output
    as the Supermarket or berkshelf-api universe endpoints.
  * Implemented Server Admins. Server Admins is a list of users that that full permissions access on the users endpoint. You can add and remove users from the Server Admins list. This allows non-superusers to perform creation, deletion, editing, and listing on all users (except the superuser) in a Chef Server, granting great flexibility around user management.
  * Implemented Chef Authentication Signing Protocol v1.3 [rfc065](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc065-sign-v1.3.md)

### API Changes and Additions
  * `/universe` (GET)

## 12.3.0 (2015-11-12)

### Chef Server
  * `policy_name` and `policy_group` are now node attributes that will
    be returned with the node object, can be set via `POST` or `PUT` to
    a node, and can be used in node searches.
  * Search Improvements:
    *  Elasticsearch is now supported as a search provider.  See 'Search'
    * You can now provide your own Solr instance instead of using the one
      bundled with chef-server.
    * It is now possible for Chef Server to post updates directly to the
      search provider bypassing rabbitmq and expander. See 'Search' in the
      Configuration section below.
    * See 'Search' in the 'Configuration Changes' section
      for information about how to enable these changes.
  * The analytics queue is now monitored, and chef-server will stop sending messages
    to it when it is full.  This resolves issues where a full queue (due
    to analytics being offline) could make the chef-server
    unusable.  Status has been added to the `/_status` endpoint.

    *Important Note*: this enables the management interface of rabbitmq,
    which requires that reconfigure generate a new secure password. This
    must be distributed to nodes in the cluster via normal upgrade procedures.
  * Connection leaks that could occur under heavy and sudden load have
    been addressed.
  * The nginx status endpoint is now available and enabled by default
    for localhost access for each chef-server node via
    [`/nginx_status`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html)
    See 'nginx' in the configuration section below.
  * An issue where mismatched cases would prevent LDAP login has been
    resolved by making LDAP auth requests case-insensitive by default.  See
    'Other' in Configuration Changes for the flag to enable case-sensitivity.
  * The appearance of the default web page when navigating to the API
    server has been updated to current Chef branding.
  * Several improvements to `dvm`, the integrated development tooling.

### Security Updates

* The update to postgres 9.2.14 addresses the following:
  * CVE-2015-3165
  * CVE-2015-3167
  * CVE-2015-5288
* The update to solr 4.10.4 addresses the following:
  * CVE-2014-3628
* The oc\_id update to `jquery-rails` addresses the following:
  * CVE-2015-1840


### Bug Fixes / Closed Issues

* [459](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/issues/459) - allow
  Chef Server to work when the postgresql port has been set in
  `chef-server.rb`
* [540](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/pull/540) - default ldap to
  case insensitve, preventing login failures where case does not match
* [528](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/pull/528) - fix spurious 400s that
  clients with persistent connections could receive after requesting `/_status`
* [536](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/pull/536)  - cinc-server-ctl
  ha-status no longer considers hidden services status
* [541](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/pull/541) - fix `HTTP 500` errors
  resulting from connection leaks to bifrost when under heavy load.
* [534](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/issues/534) - `cinc-server-ctl backup`
  now properly exits with return code 0 unless an error occurs
* [597](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/issues/597) - add retries to
  the bootstrap-platform execute resource in case required services are still
  spinning up.
* [606](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/pull/606) - oc-id now checks
  for nil username on login, fixing failure that occurred from analytics
  login.


### API Changes

  * `GET $PREFIX/nodes/$NAME` will now include in the return fields
    `policy_name` and `policy_group`.  This change is available under
    API v0 and later.
  * `POST $PREFIX/nodes` and `PUT $PREFIX/nodes/$NAME` now accept
    `policy_name` and `policy_group` as optional fields.
  * `/_status` now includes information about the analytics queue state
    when `queue_length_monitor_enabled` is set. The additional output is
    as follows:

         [..., {"analytics_queue":
                 {"queue_at_capacity": false,
                  "last_recorded_length": 0,
                  "total_length": 0,
                  "dropped_since_last_check": 0,
                  "max_length": 0,
                  "total_dropped": 0,
                  "check_count": 0,
                  "mailbox_length": 0}}
         ]

    All values shown as 0 can be 0 or more, while `queue_at_capacity`
    will be `true` or `false`.

### Contributors

### Chef Server Development Environment Improvements

  * sync tool talks less and gives only relevant information
  * fixes to loading of various projects that got broken when we moved
    to `rebar3` for builds.
  * dvm can now be resumed after poweroff state.
  * preliminary support for loading and developing the reporting plugin
    has been added, including an external reporting database node

### Deprecations

There are no deprecations to announce in this release.

### Configuration Changes

Below are the most relevant configuration options made available under Chef Server 12.3.0.  Unless
otherwise stated, the values shown are the default values.

For a complete listing of all available settings, see
[Chef Server Configuration](https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_server.html).

#### Search

##### External Solr

The following two configuration items have been added to support
external instances of solr or elasticsearch:

    opscode_solr4['external'] = false
    opscode_solr4['external_url'] = nil

When `external` is false, a local solr instance is configured and
used for search indexing.  When it is true, we assume that a solr
instance lives at the URL provided in `external_url`.

NOTE: In the case of an external solr, chef-server makes no
attempt to configure the correct indexes/schema.

##### Direct-to-Solr Indexing

Chef Server can now index directly to solr, bypassing rabbitmq
and opscode-expander.  To enable this, the following
configuration options have been added:

    # - 'rabbitmq' is the default and maintains the current behavior.
    # - 'batch' uses direct-to-solr indexing, batching index requests when possible
    opscode_erchef['search_queue_mode'] = "rabbitmq"

##### Elasticsearch Search Indexing

Chef Server now supports indexing to an external elasticsearch instance.
Enable this as follows:

    opscode_erchef['search_provider'] = "elasticsearch"
    opscode_solr4['external'] = true
    opscode_solr4['external_url'] = "https://PATH_TO_ELASTICSEARCH"
    opscode_erchef['search_queue_mode'] = "batch"

NOTE: Chef Server will not provision an elasticsearch server.

##### nginx

By default, each Chef Server node now has locally enabled the
`/nginx_status` endpoint on port 9999. This can be controlled with the
following settings:

    nginx['enable_stub_status'] = true
    nginx['stub_status']['listen_host'] = "127.0.0.1"
    nginx['stub_status']['listen_port'] = "9999"
    nginx['stub_status']['location'] = "/nginx_status"

##### Queue Monitoring

Chef Server now monitors the analytics queue and will stop attempting to
write to it when it is full.  Below are the relevant settings.

    # IPs permitted to access the endpoint
    nginx['stub_status']['allow_list'] = ["127.0.0.1"]

    # Enable the management interface. Required for queue length monitoring.
    rabbitmq['management_enabled'] = true

    # The maximum permitted length for the analytics queue.
    rabbitmq['analytics_max_length'] = 10000

    # How often do we check in on the state of the queue, in milliseconds?
    rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_millis'] = 30000

    # If we can't talk to the monitor, how long do we wait before we assume
    # it is overloaded?
    rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_timeout_millis'] = 5000

    # don't send messages to rabbitmq if it has reached it's configured max_length
    rabbitmq['drop_on_full_capacity'] = true

    # enable monitoring of the rabbit q
    rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_enabled'] = true

    # prevent erchef from starting if queue is at capacity
    rabbitmq['prevent_erchef_startup_on_full_capacity'] = false

    # If true and capacity is reached, the chef server `/_status` endpoint
    # will report 500 when the analytics queue is at capacity.
    rabbitmq['queue_at_capacity_affects_overall_status'] = false

##### Other

*Logging*

A new configuration option for bifrost and erchef  has been provided to control
flooding of logs.  Any log messages in excess of this number per second are dropped.

    opscode_erchef['log_rotation']['max_messages_per_second'] = 1000
    oc_bifrost['log_rotation']['max_messages_per_second'] = 1000

*LDAP Case Sensitivity*

By default, Chef Server will use case insensitive authentication against
LDAP servers, as shown below.  Set the value to `true` in your
chef-server configuration to restore the previous case-sensitive behavior.

    ldap['case_sensitive_login_attribute'] = false

## 12.2.0 (2015-09-01)

### Chef Server

  * New Policyfile endpoints have been added to enable cleanup of policy
    objects.  See API Changes below for more detail.
  * Org Policy Changes:
    * rename `ORG_global_admins` to `ORG_read_access_group`
    * new restrictions that prevent removing `admins` group ACE from a
      group's ACL.
    * users in the same org can now by default read each others' user
      records.
    * See "Organization Policy Changes" below for more details.
  * It is now possible to configure a new installation of Chef Server to
    use a self-hosted PostgreSQL instance, including Amazon RDS
    PostgreSQL. See [this page](https://docs.chef.io/release/server_12-2/release_notes.html#external-postgresql) for details.
    * Note that direct upgrades to an external postgresql instance are
      not supported at this time.  Instead,  back up the existing Chef
      Server using knife ec backup, bring up a new Chef Server with
      external PostgreSQL configure, then use knife ec restore.
    * If you wish to use `cinc-server-ctl cleanse` and have it delete
      data from an external PostgreSQL instance as well, you must use
      the new flag `--with-external`.

#### cinc-server-ctl

  * New commands `backup` and `restore` which you can use to back up
    to/restore a Chef Server's data in its entirety.
      * To use this feature at this time, you will need to ensure that
        `rsync` is installed on the server ahead of time.
      * If you have enabled external postgresql, use `knife ec backup'
        instead of cinc-server-ctl backup/restore backup/restore, as
        cinc-server-ctl backup/restore are not yet compatible with
        external data stores.
  * New command `cinc-server-ctl psql <service-name>` to log in via `psql` with
    read-only access to the the postgresql database used by the named
    service.  This is now the preferred way to log into a Chef Server
    database, and will automatically handle authentication. Use
    `--write` to enable write access.
  * `reindex` now supports server-wide reindexing.
  * Improved error output.  When errors exist in `chef-server.rb`
    or we detect errors in external postgresql setup, we now provide clear
    errors and - where appropriate - links to supporting documentation.
    This is an ongoing process, so further improvements should be expected
    in this space.
  * Enhancements to the cinc-server-ctl add-on framework now permit custom
    topologies.
  * `status`, `cleanse`, `service-list` commands have been updated to
    support external PostgreSQL.  Other service commands have been
    disabled when external PostgreSQL is in use.
  * cinc-server-ctl will now refuse to run as anyone other than root,
    instead of giving a confusing stack trace when this is attempted.

#### Chef Server Development Environment Improvements

  * Chef Server's self-contained development environment 'dvm' has been
    updated to support loading of omnibus gems, and with support for
    auto-loading omnibus components before the first VM reconfigure has
    been run.
  * For testing/experimenting with external PostgreSQL,
    `dev/config.yml.example` shows how to enable a second `database` VM
    in dvm. This will hosting an external PostgreSQL database, and
    configures Chef Server to enable on the primary VM.

### Authorization Service (oc\_bifrost)
 * A deadlock has been resolved that can occur when concurrent
   updates to the same actor are made.  Consistent with the overall
   Chef Server API, the last update in will be the one that takes
   precedence.

### Identity Service (oc\_id)
 * Additional steps have been taken to ensure that unless newrelic support is expressly
   configured, the service will not call home to newrelic. This fixes a
   problem that affects 12.1.0, 12.1.1, 12.1.2.
 * Ensure that `oc-id` is reachable from the load balancer under ipv4 and ipv6.

### Deprecations

There are no deprecations to announce in this release.

### Bug Fixes / Closed Issues
* [CHEF-SERVER-154](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/issues/154)
  Do not enable automatic/unattended upgrades of Chef Server on RHEL when
  the packagecloud repository has been added for add-ons are present.
  If this has already been enabled prior to this point, disable it on
  the next reconfigure.
* [CHEF-SERVER-437](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/issues/437)
  The license endpoint now only reports on nodes associated with an
  organization.
* When there is a username/client collision and the request originates
  from Manage, ensure that user is used to authenticate the request
  instead of client.
* When upgrading from EC11 and OSC11, custom solr configuration
  is preserved.
* Multi-byte encoding issues in dependency resolution (depsolver) have
  been fixed.
* Newrelic support is now disabled for all profiles in oc-id unless
  explicitly configured.
* `--expiration-date` is no longer ignored by the `add-*-key`
  commands.

### API Changes and Additions
 * New Policyfile endpoints, available under v0 and later:
   * `/policies/:policy_name` (GET, DELETE)
   * `/policies/:policy_name/revisions` (POST)
   * `/policies/:policy_name/revisions/:revision_id` (GET, DELETE)
   * `/policy_groups/:policy_group_name` (GET, DELETE)
 * Attempts by anybody other than superuser to PUT a group ACL that
   does not contain a grant ACE for the `admins` group will receive a
   403.

### Security Updates
 * upgraded to openssl-1.0.1p for CVE-2015-1793.   Note that Chef Server
   was not directly affected by this CVE.

### Organization Policy Changes
* It is no longer possible to remove an organization's admin group's grant ACE
  from a group. This prevents a class of errors where the admins group is
  inadvertantly removed, preventing subsequent updates to the group's ACL.
* The group misleadingly named `$ORG_global_admins` where $ORG is the
  organization's name has been renamed to `$ORG_global_read_group`, which more
  accurately affects the access given to that group.
* Users that share an organization will be able to read each other's user records.
  This allows users to encrypt data bag items for each other using `knife-vault`
  without granting these users admin access.
  * Being able to read another user's user object means you can look up that
    person's public keys registered with the chef server, shared organizations,
    email address, and name.
  * Users can *only* see the org memberships when those organizations
    are in common to both users.  They can *not* see organziation
    memberships that are not shared.

## 12.1.2 (2015-07-16)

Fix issue where cinc-server-ctl install could not fetch remote packages via apt.

## 12.1.1 (2015-07-13)

This is a bug fix release which fixes bugs related to upgrades from
Open Source and Enterprise Chef 11.

This release also ships openssl 1.0.1p; however, Chef Server was not
vulnerable to CVE-2015-1793 since no version of Chef Server shipped
the affected versions.

## 12.1.0 (2015-06-18)

The following items are new since Chef Server 12.0.8 and/or are changes from
previous versions.  For specific breakdown of updated components, refer to
CHANGELOG.md.

Additional items will be highlighted here for further RC updates, then
consolidated into the overall 12.1.0 release notes as part of the final
12.1.0 release.

### Chef Server
  * Expose queue configuration for erchef and bifrost connection pools
  * A new gather-log script gathers a lot more debugging information for
    use in support requests.
  * Optionally send application statistics using the statsd
    protocol. To send statsd-formatted statistics,
    set `estatsd['protocol'] = "statsd"` in chef-server.rb.
  * expose postgres WAL configurables in chef-server.rb
  * cinc-server-ctl key commands now use the keys API
  * remove darklaunch flags that controlled routing of requests to couch
    vs postgres, and oc_erchef vs opscode-account.
  * Fix local-mode-cache warnings on `cinc-server-ctl reconfigure`
  * Erlang runtime upgraded to 17.5

#### Chef Server Development Improvements

* Many of Chef Server's components have been consolidated, allowing
  Chef to increase the rate at which we can deliver improvements. The
  new consolidated repository can be found at
  https://github.com/chef/chef-server.
* A new self-contained development environment greatly simplifies and
  speeds up the process of developing Chef Server components.  This
  also eases the path for those outside of the Chef organization
  who wish to contribute to Chef Server. You can find this here:
  https://github.com/chef/chef-server/tree/master/dev.  Feedback and
  suggestions are welcome.
* Many less-visible improvements all contribute to making Chef Server
  easier to enhance and maintain, including improved test coverage,
  better static code analysis, coverage analysis, removal of redundant
  paths, unified build/make process, and extensive refactoring of code.

### REST API Service (oc\_erchef)
  * Server API version is now `1`, and this release deprecates API v0.
    See Deprecations below for more information.
  * All support for couch has been removed, along with darklaunch flags
    that would allow switching between CouchDB and Postgres.
  * New behaviors introduced under APIv1 for Clients, Users, and Principals.  See
    API Changes and Additions
  * Multiple performance enhancements:
    * Improve performance of depsolver endpoint by using a bulk query for
      cookbook versions.
    * Reduce bulk query to retrieve minimum required data, which
      provided a significant performance improvement.
    * Changes to reduce the number of redundant database calls made from many
      endpoints
    * Eliminate unecessary postgresql transactions caused by recent versions of sqerl.
    * Wire-level performance enhancements for postgres communications that
      significantly reduce the number of network packets required for
      most transactions.


### Authorization Service (oc\_bifrost)

  * Wire-level performance enhancements for postgres
  * Eliminate unecessary postgresql transactions caused by recent versions of sqerl.

### Identity Service (oc\_id)

  * Ensure that unless newrelic support is expressly configured, the
    service will not call home to newrelic.
  * The UI has been updated as part of our ongoing effort to improve the look
    and feel of all Chef applications.

### Deprecations

  * Server API version is currently `1`.  Version `0` is deprecated.
    This includes several v0 behaviors for the Users, Clients and
    Prinicpals endpoints.  See API Changes and Additions for more details.
  * The response header `X-Ops-API-Info` is also deprecated. Version `0`
    requests will continue to receive it alongside the new
    `X-Ops-Server-API-Version` header, while Version `1`+ will receive only
    the latter.

### Changes in Behavior

  * As a side effect of keys-related changes Clients under
    API v1, searches for clients created using v1 of the API will no longer
    include client public keys in the response.  When API v0 is
    desupported, this will become the default behavior.

### Bug Fixes / Closed Issues

  * API requests made by a user that shares a name with a client in the
    same org wil no longer fail with a 401.
  * Fix bug where cinc-server-ctl install command would
    always attempt to reinstall previously installed packages.
  * Fix a fatal `oc_erchef` crash that occurred when `folsom_graphite` is configured,
    but no server is avaiable or the server goes away.
  * Prevent graphite failures from causing `oc_erchef` to crash when
    `folsom_graphite` is enabled.
  * Pull in newest folsom and bear to address `folsome_graphite` crashes.
  * Fix local-mode-cache warnings on `cinc-server-ctl reconfigure`
    (Issue #106)
  * Restart procps server to ensure sysctl tuning is applied.
  * Correct path to DRBD split brain notification script.
  * Remove install message from postinst package script
  * Fix bug where `cinc-server-ctl reconfigure` would
    fail if rabbitmq['nodename'] had been changed.
  * Fixes chef-server issue #119 which prevented some LDAP users from
    successfully logging in.
  * Correct path to DRBD split brain notification script.
  * Redact password from actions data, if present.

### Security Updates

The following items are the security updates that have been applied since Chef Server 12.0.8:

* PostgreSQL 9.2.10
  * CVE-2015-0241 - Fix buffer overruns in `to_char()`
  * CVE-2015-0242 - Fix buffer overrun in replacement `*printf()` functions
  * CVE-2015-0243 - Fix buffer overruns in `contrib/pgcrypto`
  * CVE-2015-0244 - Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization
    after an error
  * CVE-2014-8161 - Fix information leak via constraint-violation error messages
  * CVE-2014-0067 - Lock down regression testing's temporary installations on Windows
* Redact password from actions data, if present.
* Redis 2.8.21
  * CVE-2015-4335: Redis Lua Sandbox Escape

### API Changes and Additions

Complete API change documentation and coverage of new features will be
be provided with the 12.1.0 final final release.

Server API Version support is enabled via the `X-Ops-Server-API-Version`
request header. Current valid values are `0` and `1`.

Server API Version `0` is deprecated with the release of 12.1.0.

*Changes implemented under API v0+*

These additions and behaviors are in effect for API v0 and any later versions:

  * Policyfile, Policy Groups, and Cookbook Artifact endpoints are now
    considered final and are available for use.
  * When creating or updating a key via the Keys API, it is now possible
    to include `create_key: true` in the request body to use a server-generated
    private key. In this case, the fields `public_key` and `private_key` will be
    returned along with the existing response body.
  * If request header `X-Ops-Server-API-Version` is not provided by the
    client, be considered `0` instead of the lowest-supported version.
  * Response header `X-Ops-Server-API-Version` has been implemented for
    all requests, and will indicate the version level at which each
    request was services.
  * In client creation and update, the last remnants of the `admin` flag
    have been removed. It was previously partially supported in that we
    would capture and update the value, but the value was unused in the system.
    If submitted in POST/PUT of a client or user, it is ignored.

*Changes implemented under API v1+*

These changes are in effect only if the requestor specifies API version
of `1` or higher. Clients that do not request this version or explicitly
request version `0` will continue to see unmodified behavior under API
v0, until that version is desupported.

  * Response header X-Ops-API-Info is not included in responses.
  * Clients and Users
    * GET of named client/user will no longer include a `public_key`
      field.  Instead use `GET /clients/:name/keys` to list keys, and
      `GET /clients/:name/keys/:key_name` to view the `public_key`
      value.
    * A default key can be created when POSTing create a new client or user
      by including either a `public_key` value or `create_key: true` in
      the request body.
    * If neither `public_key` nor `create_key` is provided in the request
      body, the client or user will be created without a key.  A key can
      be added later via the keys endpoint for the client/user.
    * Certificates are no longer accepted as a valid `public_key` value
      when POSTing to create a client. Only public keys are accepted.
    * Keys can no longer be updated via a PUT request to client or user -
      instead perform the PUT request to the keys endpoint.
    * Including any of `public_key`, `private_key`, or `create_key` in PUT
      requests to client/users will cause a 400 response with detailed message.
    * If a key is created for a new client or user via `public_key` or `create_key`,
      a `chef_key` object will be included in the response. The `chef_key` will
      also include the key's URL which can be used for updates and removal.
      If the key has been generated by the server, then `private_key` will
      be included in the embedded `chef_key`.
  * The Principals endpoint will return a list of principal data for all
    matching principals within a container object in the form
    `{ "principals" : [{...},... ] }`.  The fields within each `principal`
    record in the list are unmodified from v0.

#### Compatibility Notes

  * Client Support for APIv1 is underway and is expected to be released
    shortly.
  * Current server Add-Ons will work with 12.1.0.  However, reporting,
    push server, and analytics may not work correctly if multiple keys are
    configured for clients or users. Updates to these products to enable
    support for Chef Server API v1 and multi-key are forthcoming.
  * If you are upgrading from 12.0.7 or earlier and have any existing
    organizations that does not have the default `users`, `admins`, and/or
    `clients` groups, then policyfiles, policy groups, and cookbook artifacts
    may  not work correctly for these organizations.  If your existing
    organizations do have these groups, then the new endpoints will work
    as expected.

### Release History

* RC1 - 2015-05-27 (internal)

## 12.0.8 (2015-04-20)

The following items are new since Chef Server 12.0.7 and/or are changes from previous versions.  For specific breakdown of updated components, refer to CHANGELOG.md

* oc\_erchef
  * Server API Versioning is now enabled and current API version is `0`.
    See chef-rfc/rfc-041 for details on server API versioning support.
* `cinc-server-ctl`
  * has been updated to use the Keys API for key management commands.
  * `--enable-external-auth` option to command `cinc-server-ctl password` has been fixed

### Security Updates

The following items are the security updates that have been applied since Chef Server 12.0.7

* OpenResty 1.7.7.10 (nginx)
  * CVE-2013-2028 - a stack-based buffer overflow might occur in a worker process while handling a specially crafted request, potentially resulting in a   rbitrary code execution
  * CVE-2013-4547 - a character following an unescaped space in a request line was handled incorrectly
  * CVE-2014-0088 -  memory corruption might occur in a worker process on 32-bit platforms while handling a specially crafted request by `ngx_http_spdy_module`, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution
  * CVE-2014-0133 - a heap memory buffer overflow might occur in a worker process while handling a specially crafted request by `ngx_http_spdy_module`, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution
  * CVE-2014-3556 - pipelined commands were not discarded after STARTTLS command in SMTP proxy

### Issue Fixes
  * [opscode-omnibus-744](https://github.com/chef/opscode-omnibus/issues/744)
  * [chef-server-142](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/issues/142)

## 12.0.7 (2015-03-26)

The following items are new since Chef Server 12.0.6 and/or are changes from previous versions.
For specific breakdown of updated components, refer to CHANGELOG.md

  * Implements the minimum set of Policyfile endpoints required for end
    to end usage of Policyfiles. Requires Chef Client 12.2+ and ChefDK
    0.5+. The upgrade process is still being tested so this only works
    with a brand new installation, and you must set
    `lb["xdl_defaults"]["policies"] = true` in the `chef-server.rb`
    file. Chef Client and ChefDK also require feature flags in their
    respective configurations to enable "native" Policyfile APIs.

  * Search results respect ACLs. (Disabled by default)
    To enable, ensure that `opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`
    is set to `true` in `chef-server.rb`. This will default to enabled
    in the next major version.

## 12.0.6 (2015-03-19)

The following items are new since Chef Server 12.0.5 and/or are changes from previous versions.
For specific breakdown of updated components, refer to CHANGELOG.md

    * anonymous binds now work properly.
    * re-enhancement: re-added support for `group_dn` ldap attribute to require users to be in the named group.
      This change was originally in 12.0.1 but was lost in our transition to a new repository.
      Thanks to Brian Felton for the original enhancement.
* `cinc-server-ctl` has been fixed to properly escape shell metacharacters
  in arguments to user- and org- commands.
* `knife-ec-backup` has been updated with key rotation support
* `chef-server.rb` tunables
  * `ldap['bind_dn']` can now be left unspecified for anonymous binds if

  `default_orgname` has been provided.  All org-related requests that are not
  in the form '/organizations/X/...' will be assumed to have this organization name.
* `private-chef.rb` and `chef-server.rb`
  * `private-chef.rb`  has been replaced by `chef-server.rb`
  * if you are upgrading from EC11 and have a `private-chef.rb` in place,
    a symlink from `chef-server.rb` to `private-chef.rb` will be created for
    you when you upgrade.
  * If you do not have a `private-chef.rb` or `chef-server.rb`, a `chef-server.rb`
    will be created for you at installation.
* LDAP
  * STARTTLS is now properly supported for LDAP.  If your LDAP server supports it
    you can enable it via `ldap['start_tls'] = true` in `/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb`.
  * the `ldap['encryption']` setting is deprecated. (See Deprecations
    section, below.)
* cinc-server-ctl
  * `cinc-server-ctl` replaces `private-chef-ctl` though
    `private-chef-ctl` will also work in CS12.
  * Several commands added related to the management of users and
    organizations, allowing management of organizations without the management console
    or original webui. You can find information about these commands via `cinc-server-ctl help`.
    and looking under "Organization and User Management Commands".  You can find usage
    examples at this location: https://docs.chef.io/install_server.html
  * new `gather-logs` command to create a tarball of important logs and system information.
* Org Policy Changes
  * it is now required that a user be removed from an organization's "admins" group
    before being removed from the organization.

  * `oc_chef_authz` settings are now tuneable
  * postgesql slow query logging can now be configured
* Upgrades from Open Source Chef 11.1
  * The `cinc-server-ctl upgrade` command has been augmented to support upgrading from Open Source Chef 11.1
     or greater.
    * In addition, three additional cinc-server-ctl commands have been added:
      `chef12-upgrade-download`, `chef12-upgrade-data-transform`, and `chef12-upgrade-upload`, which allow
       the upgrade process to be broken down into discrete steps if more control is desired than the upgrade
       command alone provides.
    * Run any of these commands with -h to see the full help menu and all the possible options that can be set.
      In addition, refer to the docs at https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server.html#from-chef-server-osc and
      https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server_open_source_notes.html#manual-upgrades for more information.

### Bug Fixes:

The following items are the set of bug fixes that have been applied since Enterprise Chef 11.2:

* [OC-11703] Fix bug that prevents ACL and group expansion when containing group that no longer exists
* [OC-10470] Allow private-chef-ctl status to ignore disabled services
* [OC-11574] private-chef-ctl service commands should be HA-aware
* [OC-9877] Exclude binary files and archives from 'omnibus-ctl tail'
* [opcode-omnibus-597] Ensure postgresql is set with shared memory less than SHMAX.
* Fix `oc_chef_authz` timeout tunable

### Security Updates

Following are security-related component updates introduced since
Enterprise Chef 11.2

* [oc\_erchef] Default data bag ACL change (rc6) details below.
* [opscode-omnibus] Adjust perms to 0750 for all service log directories
* [opscode-omnibus] openssl 1.0.1j to address CVE-2014-3513, CVE-2014-3567, and CVE-2014-3568
* [opscode-omnibus] disable SSLv3 by default at the load balancers
* [opscode-omnibus] Ensure contents of install dir (/opt/opscode) are owned by root.

### API Changes
* `POST` to `/organizations/ORGNAME/groups` now ignores any initial list of users
  and clients provided
* "flavor" header returned from REST API calls is now "cs"
* maximum chef client version is no longer checked

### Organization Policy Changes

*Default Data Bag ACL Change*

Previously, the default permissions of data bags permitted clients
(nodes) to update them, such as during a chef-client run. This has
been modified so that in any new orgs created after this update,
clients will not have write access to data bags.  If you require
the original behavior in organizations created after this update,
you can use the knife acl[1] plugin to add permissions as follows:

    knife acl add containers data update group clients

If you have cookbooks that are creating new data bags, or deleting data
bags, you will also need to add 'create' and 'delete' permissions
respectively:

    knife acl add containers data create group clients
    knife acl add containers data delete group clients

If you want to update your existing organizations to remove
client ability to modify/create/delete new data bags (recommended if you're not
using this currently):

    knife acl remove containers data update group clients
    knife acl remove containers data delete group clients
    knife acl remove containers data create group clients

More information - including examples of modifying permissions for both
newly created data bags and existing data bags data - can be found here:

https://www.chef.io/blog/2014/11/10/security-update-hosted-chef/

[1] knife-acl is a plugin to support managing ACLs using knife, instead
of the opscode-manage interface. It can be found here: https://github.com/chef/knife-acl

*Admins Cannot be Removed From Organizations*

A significant number of the support-related issues that we've seen stem
from admins being able to remove themselves from an organization,
particularly when they are the last admin in the organization (but not
necessarily limited to this).

To help prevent this class of troubles, Chef Server now enforces that a
member of an organization's "admins" group cannot be removed from the
organization without first being removed from the "admins" group.

### Deprecations

* The setting ldap['encryption'] is now deprecated. Instead use
  `ldap['ssl_enabled'] = true` or `ldap['tls_enabled'] = true` as appropriate
  to your environment.
