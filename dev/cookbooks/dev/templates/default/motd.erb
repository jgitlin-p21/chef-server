DVM QuickStart
---------------
1. On the host, cd to cinc-server/dev, and run the below command. Leave it running.
      $ ./sync
2. In your active shell (this one!) use "sudo -i" to gain root. dvm needs it.
3. To load the cinc-server repo's erchef project and run it in the active shell:
      # dvm quickstart oc_erchef
4. To load the things you'll usually want - erchef, pedant, omnibus cookbooks:
      # dvm quickstart cinc-server
4. To run oc-chef-pedant, the server REST API spec suite:
      # dvm load oc-chef-pedant
      # dvm run oc-chef-pedant [--pedant-flags,...]
5. To start a psql session with a project's database, use:
      # dvm psql $PROJECT

Use dvm list for a list of loadable projects, and dvm list $PROJECT for a list of loadable deps.
For a lot more information about dvm see cinc-server/dev/README.md

Note that supported erlang projects will automatically hot-load your changes -
just save them from the host and they'll loaded within a few seconds.
