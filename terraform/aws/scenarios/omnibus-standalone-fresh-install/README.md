# Omnibus Standalone Fresh Install

This directory contains the Terraform code used to instantiate a single CINC Infra Server utilizing an Omnibus built artifact downloaded from `$upgrade_version_url` as the install package.

Once the server has been installed and configured, the pedant tests are run against the server.
